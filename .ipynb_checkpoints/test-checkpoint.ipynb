    "## To-do\n",
    "- Now that we have import and metadata extraction working, we need to start preprocessing (mostly interpolating timepoints for z-slices if recorded on frame-by-frame basis by the scope) and some scheme for identification of a nuclear and a spot channel that is compatible with switching between the two channels (e.g. using mCherry to segment nuclei during cycles but not at the division).\n",
    "- Makes sense to use dask for visualization (e.g. choosing a threshold).\n",
    "- Write DoG/segmentation fuction so that it can take either 2D or 3D data - give the option to segment off of a projection, or off of raw 3D data.\n",
    "    - Write in options for DoG and LoG segmentation algorithm with standard nuclear sizes vs box DoG/LoG vs watershed.\n",
    "        - Actually, box filtering might not be very helpful if we're cutting off part of the nucleus is z - the BP filtering will project it into a distorted gaussian if we're not right in the middle of the nucleus, and then misplace the centroid and botch the diameter estimation from $\\sigma$. For 3D segmentation, it might be better to use a single filter to find markers then perform a watershed.\n",
    "- 3D DoG notes:\n",
    "    - $\\sigma_{x, y} = 8$ works perfectly to segment out nuclei during nc 13.\n",
    "    - $\\sigma_z$ is BP-filtered (1, 9) where 9 is the Z-sigma corresponding to the whole nucleus. This allow the BP to be very permissive in Z and filter out the nuclei in x and y.\n",
    "- Proposed procedure for local peak finding:\n",
    "    - Run box DoG as below with permissive BP in z and LoG approximation in (x, y), only varying $\\sigma$ in the latter.\n",
    "    - Peak-finding on standard image (e.g. $\\sigma_{x, y} = 8$), then use coordinates as initial guess for next sigma values.\n",
    "- Simple BP filter + peak finding does a good job finding markers. Give option then to watershed segment directly off of the image, off of distance-transformed otsu thresholded image, and off of edge-finding.\n",
    "    - For data with the mid-nuclear plane on the boundary of our z-stack, might be useful to give the option to segment in 2D, then threshold each nuclear column locally to identify the nucleus.\n",
    "    - Need to write loop over timepoints, clean up small objects at each step, then commit segmentation to file."
